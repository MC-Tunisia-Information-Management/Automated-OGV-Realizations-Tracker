# Automated-OGV-Realizations-Tracker
The script is specifically tailored for managing data related to OGV Realisations within AIESEC, leveraging Google Sheets and the GIS API. It begins with `dataExtraction_GV(graphql)`, which converts GraphQL queries into JSON payloads and sends them as POST requests to retrieve opportunity application data. This data is then formatted and processed in `dataManipulation_GV(dataSet, sheet)`, where details such as person information, opportunity specifics, dates, statuses, and background data are extracted and organized into rows. The `main_GV()` function orchestrates the entire workflow by executing multiple GraphQL queries for different subsets of data—APDs, REs, Remote REs, FIs—ensuring the Google Sheets document ("OGV") remains updated with accurate information about AIESEC opportunity applications. Additional functions like `updateECBChecks_GV()` and `updateBreaks_GV()` handle specific tasks such as updating data from external spreadsheets and managing application status changes. Together, these functions streamline the management and reporting processes specifically tailored for OGV Realisations within AIESEC operations.
